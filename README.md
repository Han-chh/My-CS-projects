# My CS Project Collection

Welcome to my CS project collection repository!  
The main purposes of this repository are:

1. **Showcase my interesting small project exercises**  
   - Including Java, Python, Web, App, and other small projects  
   - Demonstrating my practice in programming, algorithms, and application development  

2. **Help computer science students learn project code**  
   - The code in this repository is well-organized and easy to read  
   - Can be used as reference or learning material  

3. **Provide potentially useful tools**  
   - Some small utilities, experimental projects, or practical scripts  
   - Suitable for direct use in learning or small projects
4. **Suggestions & Improvements Welcome**
- Many projects in this repository were originally completed years ago and later reorganized. As a result, there may be bugs, incomplete features, version incompatibilities, or cross-platform issues.
- If you encounter any of these problems, feel free to open an issue or contact me at **13269982528@163.com** to report them.

## About This Repository

- This repository contains links to multiple project folders, each corresponding to an individual small project  
- Each project also has its own independent repository providing source code and documentation  
- You can browse the code directly, use it as a reference, or clone individual projects for practice and experimentation

> Each project's README.md contains detailed instructions and how to run it, so you can check or use them individually as needed.
